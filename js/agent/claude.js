/* agent/claude.js — the optional Claude connection.

   The built-in engine answers the common questions offline. This adds
   open-ended ones on top, by sending a snapshot of the current data to the
   Claude API and streaming the answer back.

   There is no server here — this site is static files — so the request goes
   straight from the browser to api.anthropic.com with the operator's own key.
   Anthropic gates that path behind an explicit header, and the key lives in
   this browser's localStorage, readable by anything that can run script on
   this origin. That's an acceptable trade for a back-of-house tool used by
   trusted staff on their own devices, and a bad one for a page the public can
   reach. The Ask tab says so before it takes a key. */
